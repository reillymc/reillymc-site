I'm a Passionate full-stack software developer with experience working in large-scale projects
across multiple industries. Proven ability to leverage technical skills and a strong work
ethic, independently and as part of a team, delivering outcomes that drive product success and
technical innovation.

<br/>

I enjoy building software that delivers great user experiences, solves real-world problems, and is architected cleanly.

For frontend development, most of my professional experience is with React. For personal projects, React Native has generally been my choice (see [Framerate](https://github.com/reillymc/Framerate) and Lamington). I’ve also explored Xamarin/.NET MAUI for [Groundsman](https://github.com/reillymc/Groundsman), SwiftUI for [Project Unleaded](https://github.com/reillymc/Project-Unleaded), and Svelte for [this website](https://github.com/reillymc/reillymc-site).

<br />

In backend development, I’ve primarily used .NET (C#) professionally. I have used Node (TypeScript) for hobby projects like [Lamington (backend)](https://github.com/reillymc/Lamington-Server). Recently, I’ve challenged myself to learn Rust for my latest project, [Framerate (backend)](https://github.com/reillymc/Framerate-Backend).

I’m a strong proponent of open source and am actively working to contribute more where I can. Examples of projects I have made contributions to include [Navidrome](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome) and [Amperfy](https://github.com/BLeeEZ/amperfy).
